/**
 * Summary: Functions are blocks of reusable code that can perform the same action in many places.
 * They are an essential for programing in Javascript.
 * Functions take in some input and return an output.
 * Javascript has built in functions but it is also possible to create new functions.
 * 
 * Defining Functions
 *  Functions can be declared as function expressions, function statements, and as arrow functions.
 * Function declaration starts with the keyword function, followed by the name of the function,
 *  a list of parameters enclosed in parenthese and seperated by commas.
 * 
 * !!Example!!
 * function makeBig(size, increase){
 *  return size + increase;}
 * 
 *  Function expressions are created by declaring a variable and initializing it to a function. 
 * It is possible to have an anonymous function defined this way.
 * 
 *  !!Example!!
 *  const small = function makeSmall(size, decrease){
 *  return size - decrease}
 * 
 * Or in the case of an anonymouse function
 *  const double - function( size, exponent){
 *  return size ** exponent }
 * 
 *  It is also possible to declare a function within a object. These are called methods. 
 * 
 * Function Parameters
 *  Parameters are the names listed in the function definition that arguments are passed into.
 * Parameters are just names while arguments are the actual values.
 * 
 * Calling Functions 
 *  Once a function has been defined to actually perform the actions indiciated in the function it must be called.
 * 
 * Function Scope 
 * Arrow functions
 * Anonymous Functions
 * Pure Functions
